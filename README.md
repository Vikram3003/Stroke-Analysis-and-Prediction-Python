According to the World Health Organization (WHO) stroke is the 2nd leading cause of death
globally, responsible for approximately 11% of total deaths. Stroke is a medical disorder in which
the blood arteries in the brain are ruptured, causing damage to the brain. When the supply of
blood and other nutrients to the brain is interrupted, symptoms might develop. According to the
World Health Organization (WHO), stroke is the greatest cause of death and disability globally.
Early recognition of the various warning signs of a stroke can help reduce the severity of the
stroke. Different machine learning (ML) models have been developed to predict the likelihood
of a stroke occurring in the brain. This research uses a range of physiological parameters and
machine learning algorithms, such as Logistic Regression (LR), Decision Tree (DT)
Classification, Random Forest (RF) Classification, and KNN Neighbors, to train four different
models for reliable prediction. Random Forest was the best performing algorithm for this task
with an accuracy of approximately 92 percent. The dataset used in the development of the method
was the open-access Stroke Prediction dataset. The accuracy percentage of the models used in
this investigation is significantly higher than that of previous studies, indicating that the models
used in this investigation are more reliable. Numerous model comparisons have established their
robustness, and the scheme can be deduced from the study analysis.
